                        <p style="text-align:justify">Hello everyone! </p>
                            
                            <p style="text-align:justify">My name is Nur Fazleen Binti Mohd Fauzi. I go by Leen, it’s quite simple and convenience to say, isn’t it? However, some people have also referred to me as Faz. I don't mind whichever nickname you decided to call me as long as it fits your manner of addressing someone.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I’m 21 years old, and my birthday is on January 5. I live in Chenor, Pahang. But, since I started my final semester on the last October 2022, I've decided to stay in Kuala Terengganu, which is my sister's home, and it's also quite close to Machang, taking only about 2 hours per trip.</p>
                            <p style="color:rgb(230, 230, 154);">Why did I choose to stay in Kuala Terengganu?</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">It's actually a good decision to travel back and forth between Machang and Kuala Terengganu whenever we have a break. It's a long drive to Pahang, and it could take hours just to get there, let alone to my house. It’s exhausting! But no worries, I would, however, occasionally phone my mother though. </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">For whatever reason, I have attended several schools from elementary to high school. This will be discussed in the education section. I like science, and business study, those are my favourite subjects. </p>

                     <body>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p style="color:rgb(230, 230, 154);">Hobbies and others :</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I enjoy reading and listening to music as well. Loud folks don't appeal to me. By loud, I mean when someone tries to draw attention to themselves by speaking loudly or by making someone else the focal point of the conversation. </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and I don't really have a particular liking, so choosing a hobby or activity that I enjoy is quite a task for me. The longest I could go before deciding to like something would probably be three months.
                              I'm not really sure what I'd do when my studies were through. However, I have developed a strong preference for being alone in a quiet place. So, the nicest options would probably be working in a library or an archive.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">I'll see you in the experience section !</p>
